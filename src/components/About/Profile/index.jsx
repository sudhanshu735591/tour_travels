                The Company had a humble beginning in 1948 from a small khokha
                in Lahori Gate, Delhi, and has now transformed into a leading
                transport company in India having a network of 350 branches

                The history of the company dates back to pre-partition days.
                Before partition, Shri S. Makhan Singh, Shri Tulsi Dass Khanna,
                Shri Sardari Lal Bahri, and Shri Murari Lal Bahri, were running
                the fleet of buses in Sargodha (now in Pakistan). After
                partition, they shifted to India and started afresh their
                transportation business in the year 1948 from Lahori Gate, Delhi
                as a small venture with 2 trucks. The hard work, determination,
                and endeavors of the founding fathers soon bore fruit and
                established the name of Jaipur Golden as one of the most trusted
                names in the transportation business.
